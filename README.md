Based on the ladder diagrams you've provided, I can help you create a README for a conveyor nut packing station. Here's a draft README file:

# Conveyor Nut Packing Station - PLC Logic

## Overview
This project implements the PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) logic for a conveyor nut packing station. The station automates the process of sorting and packing nuts using various sensors and actuators. The ladder logic is designed to control the start/stop functions, manage sensors for nut detection, and control the conveyor and hopper mechanisms for sorting and packing different types of nuts.

## System Components

### Inputs
- **Start Button (I:0/0)**: Initiates the system operation.
- **Stop Button (I:0/1)**: Stops the system operation.
- **Proximity Sensor (I:0/2)**: Detects the presence of an object on the conveyor.
- **Level Sensor (I:0/3)**: Monitors the level of nuts in the hopper.
- **Red Sensor (I:0/4)**: Detects red-colored nuts.
- **Blue Sensor (I:0/5)**: Detects blue-colored nuts.

### Outputs
- **Conveyor Motor Output (O:0/0)**: Controls the conveyor belt movement.
- **Walnut Hopper Output (O:0/1)**: Activates the walnut hopper for dispensing walnuts.
- **Pecan Hopper Output (O:0/2)**: Activates the pecan hopper for dispensing pecans.

### Internal Bits
- **B3:0/0 to B3:0/7**: Internal bits used to manage system states, such as proximity detection, level detection, and sensor status.
- **B3:1/0 to B3:1/7**: Internal bits used for system control logic, including conveyor and hopper operation.

## Ladder Logic Breakdown

### Ladder 2 - Main Program
- **Rung 0000**: Initializes the system by jumping to the `IO` and `Controls` subroutines.

### Ladder 3 - IO Handling
- **Rungs 0000-0005**: Manage input signals from start/stop buttons and various sensors.
- **Rungs 0006-0008**: Control outputs for the conveyor motor and hoppers based on the system's running status and sensor inputs.

### Ladder 4 - Control Logic
- **Rungs 0000-0002**: Implement system start/stop logic using one-shot rising (ONS) instructions for debouncing.
- **Rungs 0003-0011**: Handle the logic for conveyor and hopper operations, triggered by sensor inputs and internal bits.

## How It Works

1. **System Start**: Pressing the start button (I:0/0) sets the `system running` bit (B3:3/2), which allows the conveyor and other operations to begin.
   
2. **Object Detection**: The proximity sensor (I:0/2) detects the presence of a nut on the conveyor, which triggers the corresponding logic to activate the appropriate hopper based on sensor inputs.
   
3. **Nut Sorting**: Depending on the nut color detected by the red (I:0/4) and blue (I:0/5) sensors, the appropriate hopper (walnut or pecan) is activated to dispense nuts into the correct packaging.

4. **System Stop**: Pressing the stop button (I:0/1) resets the `system running` bit (B3:3/2), stopping all operations immediately.
